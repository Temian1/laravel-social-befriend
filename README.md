## üôå Usage

The power of example is better here. This package allows you simply to assign followers, blockings or likes without too much effort. What makes the package powerful is that you can filter queries using scopes out-of-the-box.

```php
$alice = User::where('name', 'Alice')->first();
$bob = User::where('name', 'Bob')->first();
$tim = User::where('name', 'Tim')->first();

$alice->follow($bob);

$alice->following()->count(); // 1
$bob->followers()->count(); // 1

User::followedBy($alice)->get(); // Just Bob shows up
User::unfollowedBy($alice)->get(); // Tim shows up
```

## Following

To follow other models, your model should use the `CanFollow` trait and `Follower` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanFollow;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Follower;

class User extends Model implements Follower {
    use CanFollow;
    ...
}
```

The other models that can be followed should use `CanBeFollowed` trait and `Followable` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeFollowed;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Followable;

class User extends Model implements Followable {
    use CanBeFollowed;
    ...
}
```

If your model can both follow & be followed, you can use `Follow` trait and `Following` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\Follow;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Following;

class User extends Model implements Following {
    use Follow;
    ...
}
```

Let's suppose we have an `User` model which can follow and be followed. Within it, we can now check for followers or follow new users:

```php
$zuck = User::where('name', 'Mark Zuckerberg')->first();
$user->follow($zuck);

$user->following()->count(); // 1
$zuck->followers()->count(); // 1
```

Now, let's suppose we have a `Page` model, than can only be followed:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeFollowed;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Followable;

class Page extends Model implements Followable {
    use CanBeFollowed;
    ...
}
```

By default, if querying `following()` and `followers()` from the `User` instance, the relationships will return only `User` instances. If you plan to retrieve other instances, such as `Page`, you can pass the model name or model class as an argument to the relationships:

```php
$zuckPage = Page::where('username', 'zuck')->first();

$user->follow($zuckPage);
$user->following()->count(); // 0, because it doesn't follow any User instance
$user->following(Page::class)->count(); // 1, because it follows only Zuck's page.
```

On-demand, you can check if your model follows some other model:

```php
$user->isFollowing($friend);
$user->follows($friend); // alias
```

Some users might want to remove followers from their list. The `Followable` trait comes with a `revokeFollower` method:

```php
$friend->follow($user);

$user->revokeFollower($friend);
```

**Note: Following, unfollowing or checking if following models that do not correctly implement `CanBeFollowed` and `Followable` will always return `false`.**

### Filtering followed/unfollowed models

To filter followed or unfollowed models (which can be any other model) on query, your model which you will query should use the `Rennokki\Befriended\Scopes\FollowFilterable` trait.

If your `User` model can only like other `Page` models, your `Page` model should use the trait mentioned.

```php
$bob = User::where('username', 'john')->first();
$alice = User::where('username', 'alice')->first();

User::followedBy($bob)->get(); // You will get no results.
User::unfollowedBy($bob)->get(); // You will get Alice.

$bob->follow($alice);
User::followedBy($bob)->get(); // Only Alice pops up.
```

## Blocking

Most of the functions are working like the follow feature, but this is helpful when your models would like to block other models.

Use `CanBlock` trait and `Blocker` contract to allow the model to block other models.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBlock;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Blocker;

class User extends Model implements Blocker {
    use CanBlock;
    ...
}
```

Adding `CanBeBlocked` trait and `Blockable` contract sets the model able to be blocked.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeBlocked;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Blockable;

class User extends Model implements Blockable {
    use CanBeBlocked;
    ...
}
```

For both, you should be using `Block` trait & `Blocking` contract:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\Block;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Blocking;

class User extends Model implements Blocking {
    use Block;
    ...
}
```

Most of the methods are the same:

```php
$user->block($user);
$user->block($page);
$user->unblock($user);

$user->blocking(); // Users that this user blocks.
$user->blocking(Page::class); // Pages that this user blocks.
$user->blockers(); // Users that block this user.
$user->blockers(Page::class); // Pages that block this user.

$user->isBlocking($page);
$user->blocks($page); // alias to isBlocking
```

### Filtering blocked models

Blocking scopes provided takes away from the query the models that are blocked. Useful to stop showing content when your models blocks other models.

Make sure that the model that will be queried uses the  `Rennokki\Befriended\Scopes\BlockFilterable` trait.

```php
$bob = User::where('username', 'john')->first();
$alice = User::where('username', 'alice')->first();

User::withoutBlockingsOf($bob)->get(); // You will get Alice and Bob as results.

$bob->block($alice);
User::withoutBlockingsOf($bob)->get(); // You will get only Bob as result.
```

## Liking

Apply `CanLike` trait and `Liker` contract for models that can like:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanLike;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Liker;

class User extends Model implements Liker {
    use CanLike;
    ...
}
```

`CanBeLiked` and `Likeable` trait can be used for models that can be liked:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeLiked;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Likeable;

class Page extends Model implements Likeable {
    use CanBeLiked;
    ...
}
```

Planning to use both, use the `Like` trait and `Liking` contact:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\Like;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Liking;

class User extends Model implements Liking {
    use Like;
    ...
}
```

As you have already got started with, these are the methods:

```php
$user->like($user);
$user->like($page);
$user->unlike($page);

$user->liking(); // Users that this user likes.
$user->liking(Page::class); // Pages that this user likes.
$user->likers(); // Users that like this user.
$user->likers(Page::class); // Pages that like this user.

$user->isLiking($page);
$user->likes($page); // alias to isLiking
```

### Filtering liked content

Filtering liked content can make showing content easier. For example, showing in the news feed posts that weren't liked by an user can be helpful.

The model you're querying from must use the `Rennokki\Befriended\Scopes\LikeFilterable` trait.

Let's suppose there are 10 pages in the database.

```php
$bob = User::where('username', 'john')->first();
$page = Page::find(1);

Page::notLikedBy($bob)->get(); // You will get 10 results.

$bob->like($page);
Page::notLikedBy($bob)->get(); // You will get only 9 results.
Page::likedBy($bob)->get(); // You will get one result, the $page
```

## Follow requests

This is similar to the way Instagram allows you to request follow of a private profile.

To follow other models, your model should use the `CanFollow` trait and `Follower` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanFollow;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Follower;

class User extends Model implements Follower {
    use CanFollow;
    ...
}
```

The other models that can be followed should use `CanBeFollowed` trait and `Followable` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeFollowed;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Followable;

class User extends Model implements Followable {
    use CanBeFollowed;
    ...
}
```

If your model can both follow & be followed, you can use `Follow` trait and `Following` contract.

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\Follow;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Following;

class User extends Model implements Following {
    use Follow;
    ...
}
```

Let's suppose we have an `User` model which can follow and be followed. Within it, we can now check for follower requests or request to follow a users:

```php
$zuck = User::where('name', 'Mark Zuckerberg')->first();
$user->followRequest($zuck);

$user->followRequests()->count(); // 1
$zuck->followerRequests()->count(); // 1
$user->follows($zuck); // false
$zuck->acceptFollowRequest($user); // true
$user->follows($zuck); // true
```

Now, let's suppose we have a `Page` model, than can only be followed:

```php
use Rennokki\Befriended\Traits\CanBeFollowed;
use Rennokki\Befriended\Contracts\Followable;

class Page extends Model implements Followable {
    use CanBeFollowed;
    ...
}
```

You can then request or cancel the follow requests:

```php
$user->followRequest($zuck);
$user->cancelFollowRequest($zuck);
```

The one being followed can accept or decline the requests:

```php
$zuck->acceptFollowRequest($user);
$zuck->declineFollowRequest($user);
```

By default, if querying `followRequests()` and `followerRequests()` from the `User` instance, the relationships will return only `User` instances.

If you plan to retrieve other instances, such as `Page`, you can pass the model name or model class as an argument to the relationships:

```php
$zuckPage = Page::where('username', 'zuck')->first();

$user->followRequest($zuckPage);
$user->followRequests()->count(); // 0, because it does not have any requests from any User instance
$user->followerRequests(Page::class)->count(); // 1, because it has a follow request for Zuck's page.
```

**Note: Requesting, accepting, declining or checking if following models that do not correctly implement `CanBeFollowed` and `Followable` will always return `false`.**
